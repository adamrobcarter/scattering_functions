# Scattering Functions

A library to calculate the intermediate scattering function / dynamic structure factor F(k, t) and F_s(k, t) from particle coordinates, obtained from (eg) TrackPy. Can therefore also calulate the structure factor S(k).

## Instalation
Clone the repository somewhere, and run `pip install -e .`

## Use
Now you should be able to do `import scattering_functions` in python. See `example.py` for more.

## Support
This code is very much pre-release and is liable to change at any time. If the code would be helpful to you, feel free to contact me (adam.rob.carter@gmail.com) while the documentation is lacking.
